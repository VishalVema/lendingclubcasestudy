## General Information

### Project Information
- In this project we are performing EDA for Loan Risk Assessment.

### Project Background
- The goal is to analyze data from a consumer finance company specializing in urban loans to identify patterns that predict loan default, helping to balance the risks of financial loss from defaults and missed business opportunities from declined approvals.
- To find the Loan defaulter's pattern in the given dataset.
- We are using a Loan dataset for Lending Club case study, provided in a CSV format.
