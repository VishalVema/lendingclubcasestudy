## General Information
### Project Information
- In this project we are performing EDA for Loan Risk Assessment.
### Project background

-The goal is to analyze data from a consumer finance company specializing in urban loans to identify patterns that predict loan default, helping to balance the risks of financial  loss from defaults and missed business opportunities from declined approvals.

- To find the Loan defaulter's pattern in the given dataset.

- We are using Loan data set for Lending Club case study ,Given in a csv format.


## Conclusions
### Summary of EDA Findings:
- Data is ready for advanced modeling after cleaning and preprocessing.
- Key risk factors have been identified for predictive modeling.
### Next Steps:
- Develop risk prediction models using insights from EDA.
- Continuously monitor data quality for future analyses.



## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 2.0.3
- Matplotlib - version 3.7.2
- Seaborn - version 0.12.2
